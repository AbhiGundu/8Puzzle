# 8Puzzle
The 8-puzzle is a classic sliding puzzle game, also known as the "tile puzzle." The game consists of a board with nine squares, and eight numbered tiles that can slide around on the board. The goal of the game is to rearrange the tiles so that they are in numerical order, with the empty space in the bottom-right corner of the board.
